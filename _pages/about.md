AlToGeLiS is an international consortium to reveal structures of data with algebra, topology, and geometry with a focus on data arising in the life sciences.

Mathematics offers a rich tool box for data analysis tasks. Algebra, topology, and geometry are particularly well-suited to encode data in a ompact way and to reveal hidden structures. We aim to provide an international network for researchers to apply, develop, and promote such mathematical techniques for data analysis.
Our advisory board is formed by Sandra di Rocco (KTH), Heather Harrington (Oxford), Kathryn Hess (EPFL), Bernd Sturmfels (MPI MiS), and Caroline Uhler (MIT).

Here is how to add math
\\( c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) in the middle of a sentence.

display math
\\[ c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\]

equation
\\begin{equation} c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\end{equation}

align
\\begin{align} c &= \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\\ 1 &= 0  \\end{align}

align*
\\[ \\begin{aligned} c &= \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\\ 1 &= 0  \\end{aligned} \\]
