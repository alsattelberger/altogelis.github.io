The AlToGeLiS consortium aims to reveal the structures of data with algebra, topology, and geometry. These techniques can be used to investigate many applications in the life sciences, and to improve the classical approach of linear algebra. We want to connect the community that works in this field and strengthen collaborations. The five institutes that are the core of this consortium are EPFL, with Kathryn Hess' research group, KTH, with Sandra di Rocco's research group, MIT, with Caroline Uhler's research group, MPI MiS, with Bernd Sturmfels' research group, and University of Oxford, with Heather Harrington's research group.

Here is how to add math
\\( c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\) in the middle of a sentence.

display math
\\[ c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\]

equation
\\begin{equation} c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\end{equation}

align
\\begin{align} c &= \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\\ 1 &= 0  \\end{align}

align*
\\[ \\begin{aligned} c &= \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\\ 1 &= 0  \\end{aligned} \\]
